# cookie-clicker-simulator

This is a simulator of the popular game Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) written for the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science.

This was written in Python 2.7, and thus mainly works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_lyZBckMcDX_30.py 

Do let me know if you find a better strategy than mine (which uses cost-effectiveness)!
